# Questions to ask

# 1. Impact of NAs for certain variables, how will they impact the model.
# e.g. a missing job may become a big signifier of default in the model
# but how to differentiate between those with no job or just no imputed job

# 2. Seeing negative credit scores - what do these mean and what do i change
# them too?

# Notes

# Amount paid might be used for analysis on likelihood to default post account
# opening, but would be useless for likelihood of default at time of
# account opening. Need to decide usecase
